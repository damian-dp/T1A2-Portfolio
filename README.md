# Damian's Portfolio Website – T1A2

## **About**
The aim of this website is to create a portfolio showcasing my journey as a new full stack developer and to highlight my existing work as an experienced digital designer. Not only will it exhibit the skills I've acquired through my Coder Academy bootcamp and previous learning experiences, but it will also offer insights into my personality and non-coding-related experiences.

The primary target audience for this website consists of recruiters and hiring managers looking to fill entry-level design and full stack development/engineering positions. They may either be actively searching for candidates or have come across my application for a posted role.

## **Functionality and Features**

The key functionality and features of my portfolio website are:

- **Bento Grid System** – an imersive bento style grid system on the home page with each tile linking to one of the following:

    - Projects - case studies of my design and developemnt work that includes rational and images of the work *(includes placeholders to add future work)*

    - Articles - Long form articles where I can write about topics that relate to desing/development and can showcase my way of thinking *(includes placeholders to add future posts)*

</br>

- designed with a **mobile first** approach, using multiple break points to have suitable adapted layouts for various screen sizes
- designed with **accessibility** at front of mind:
    - a simplistic layout that does not cause sensory overload
    - alt text on all visual elements
    - colour palette designed to have meaning, even for those who are colour blind
    - semantic elements used when building layout

As I had already developed a similar website for my Diversity in Tech scholarship application, I have linked to the original website from my portfolio to demonstrate my growth since beginning this course.

## **Tech Stack**

Through the entire process from planning to deployment I used the following tech:
- **Figma** - sitemap, wireframes and UI/UX design
- **VS Code** - integrated development environment for developing the website code
- **Markdown** - for writing this README.md
- **HTML** - for the content and structure for all pages
- **CSS** - styling and animations for all pages
- **JavaScript** - for page transitions, animations, currently playing widget, local time and weather widget
- **GitHub** - version control
- **Netlify** - deployment and hosting
</br>
</br>




## **Sitemap**

This sitemap image was developed prior to commencing any coding, and remained consistent as I developed the website in terms of the structure and flow of the pages:

## **Wireframes**

Basic wireframes for each page were created in Figma prior to commencing coding. Each page has 3 versions of the wireframe for various breakpoints:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

These wireframes are high level and not indicatative of margins, padding, font sizes, etc. to be used - but rather than overall placement of elements. The key similarities across all pages are:
- **Mobile view** only has a logo in the top-left of the header, along with a hamburger menu for navigation
- **Tablet view** expands to add my name next to the logo (similar to what will show on desktop view), but retains the hamburger navigation menu
- **Desktop view** takes advantage of the larger width to have the navigation bar visible in a row in the top-right of the header
